The issue revolved around the challenge faced by intellectual property creators due to AI advancements. AI models could scrape data from Web2 platforms and use it to generate new intellectual property more efficiently than humans. This raised concerns about protecting the rights of intellectual property creators in the Web3 era.

Additionally, I recognized the need to balance IP protection with the distribution of intellectual property. Creators want their work to reach a wide audience, but they also need safeguards against unauthorized use. Thus, my goal was to create a protocol that would benefit IP creators whenever their property was used as a reference for generating new content.

The Intellectual Property Exchange Protocol
With these insights and experiences in mind, I set out to develop an Intellectual Property Exchange Protocol. The protocol had several key objectives:
Protect the intellectual property rights of creators.
Incentivize users whenever they used intellectual property as a reference.
Address the issue of AI using intellectual property for training.
The protocol was built using smart contracts as the foundation, leveraging the capabilities of the Aptos blockchain network for secure access key and token transfers.

The project was divided into two phases:

Phase 1: Intellectual Property Protection
In the first phase, we developed a smart contract that allowed intellectual property creators to store their content in the cloud. Users could only access this content by obtaining a key, which could be generated once and required a token transfer to the creator. This mechanism ensured that creators could protect their intellectual property from being used to train AI models without their consent.

Phase 2: AI Training with IP References
In the second phase, we planned to use the data stored in the cloud platform with key-based access to train AI models in real time. Unlike Web2, where data could be scraped freely, Web3 required a key and token transfer to access intellectual property. This approach ensured that every AI-generated output could be traced back to the original intellectual property references used for its creation.

Impact and Future Prospects
The Intellectual Property Exchange Protocol has the potential to benefit intellectual property creators, AI developers, and even government bodies looking to regulate AI usage. It can also assist distribution channels like YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram in authenticating content on their platforms.

As Web3 adoption continues to grow, this protocol aligns with the evolving ecosystem. The transition from Web2 to Web3 infrastructure by major platforms is imminent, and our protocol can play a vital role in authenticating and safeguarding content in this new paradigm.
